//////the following notes are from watching the Netflix RxJS+Redux+React talk///////
//general notes about terms I didn't know
(AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML, unrelated but didn't know this lol)
(debounce = "The debounce function delays the processing of the keyup event until the user has stopped typing for a predetermined amount of time. This prevents your UI code from needing to process every event and also drastically reduces the number of API calls sent to your server." //this is often used for autocomplete searches. it only checks if you've stopped typing for x amount of time.)

//rxjs & redux-observable notes
-Observables are an alternative to promises
    >advantages:  stream of zero, one, or more values (promises are always 1); over any amount of time; CANCELLABLE;

-"lodash for async"

-you subscribe to observables (like .on in firebase???)

-you can map, filter, reduce, concat, merge, debounce, throttle, combineLatest, etc on observables
    >there's a built in delay operator
    >switchMap implicitly cancels old queries when a new one happens

*-they start talking about "Epics" in the context of using rxjs with redux
    >redux-observable

-they recommend using redux-observable for *complex async tasks over any amount of time*
    >also recommend learning rxjs before redux-observable
    >"reactive programming"
